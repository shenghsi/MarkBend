# Inactive point comparison checks

## Rejected parser selection

document-language.ts is a rejected inactive selector. It uses the package YAML
wrapper for empty, whitespace, BOM, dash, and nonstandard range inputs; other
starts use package Markdown. Fragments retain their native root identity and
the selector returns each native PartialParse unchanged. No shared last-choice
state exists. Tests cover shared support, first-line switches, exact BOM/mixed
line-ending source and Undo/Redo, complete preview, highlighting, completion,
folding, metadata, indentation, and a controlled partial prefix.

Two narrow adapters match metadata and indentation at document edges. They do
not match native language activity, which reads languageDataProp from the tree.
The negative control records Markdown true/wrapper false on the candidate and
Markdown false/wrapper true on the baseline at start sides -1/0 and end sides
0/1. Empty and ambiguous prefix fixtures retain the wrapper route. Complete
region queries agree in the tested fixtures. Seven checks pass, including this
explicit rejection control; this is not seven adoption contracts proved.
Do not add a browser flag or use this selector in the app. No timing was run.
Production retains the package YAML wrapper.

Validation: seven selector checks, four local-coverage checks, and twenty related
observer/static-preview/comparator checks pass. TypeScript and `bend PROOF.bend`
pass. The Bend gate covers the named Bend laws, not this TypeScript selector.

## Local published coverage

local-index.ts is an inactive production-index snapshot. Default routes still
use the original function. local=1 explicitly selects this snapshot in the input
fixture. It keeps initial complete eligibility, lexical/source/selection guards,
stable notes, and bounded neighbour correspondence. Dirty and neighbour nodes
must be complete published top-level Markdown blocks. Both directions need an
identical validated outer block or an edge confirmed by the mapped old index.
Missing siblings in a partial tree cannot prove an edge. The edge query stops
after two entries and rejects unexpected overlap. This caps callbacks only:
installed RangeSet.between still scans chunk positions. Constant or fully bounded
query work is unproved. The off-screen projection
comes from the prior complete index, not a builder on the current partial tree.

Four controlled positive edits use direct package Markdown. The test adapter
uses the public PartialParse.stopAt method at 1024 and clipped fragments after
the first edit. Initial eligibility comes from a complete tree. Each candidate
remains partial while a separate state is fully parsed for the independent
source/decorations/point-mark oracle. Oracle work never settles the candidate.
This is a different language profile, not a performance or app acceptance result.

The package YAML wrapper is a required rejection control. In the observed
partial tree of length 220, dirty position 11..32 resolves to Body 0..220 without
a mounted Markdown tree. A severe budget control publishes only length 10.
Both lack required local coverage. A truncated boundary-neighbour control also
rejects. Structural insertions, resources, and changed notes use the full path.
Twenty-four focused checks and TypeScript pass. No production guard changes.
Next review conservative selection of package parsers with full front-matter,
language-service, source/history, and layout controls before browser timing.

## First real-key comparison

The later diagnostics=1 route adds post-clock mounted-body and fallback records.
fallback-observer.ts transparently forwards updateIndex and its original callback,
and keeps only a small WeakMap record of call, return, and existing rejection.
Raw samples retain no transaction, state, or plan. Classification checks silent
guards in order and reports unknown where bounded observation is insufficient.
It does not force parsing, replay updates, rebuild full previews, or scan a large
note list. The old complete field remains outer-tree length for compatibility.

input-fallback-diagnosis.json has two forty-key runs. Original accepts seven
keys, rejects key eight with incomplete published Markdown body, then has
thirty-two no-index edits. Paired accepts forty keys. All source/Undo checks pass;
the routes differ. Run verify-fallback.mjs. Twenty focused tests verify observer
source/decorations/return/callback parity, static preview, and comparator setup.
This identifies an observed fallback cause, not a stable speed gain. Production
is unchanged. Investigate local published coverage without dropping dependency
or source guards.

paired-input.html uses one standalone static edit surface with the original
comparator or the test-only wrapper. Source, extensions, CSS, selection, and
the 1 MiB note fixture are shared. It excludes the main app and host work.
Setup publishes a complete parse outside clocks. The four runs use ABBA order,
forty real browser locator key presses each, and direct DOM terminal reads
between keys. No forceParsing or diagnostic realization runs between keys.
The first regex-based observation timed out after the first key; a direct DOM
read confirmed the completed sample. That sample is retained. Later reads use
the exact sample count, without repeating or skipping a key. The fixture's
median uses the upper middle sample when the sample count is even.

All 160 keys and four source/Undo gates pass. Outer-tree counts are 40/11/9/3.
Original key-to-rAF p95 is 24.8/172.8 ms; paired p95 is 132.8/102.9 ms. Three runs
lose their indexed route, so this establishes no stable speed gain. The inherited
complete sample field checks outer tree length only; mounted-body availability
must be recorded separately before attributing the fallback cause.
All samples remain, including full and partial routes. Comparator final counts
include source-check and Undo work; they are not timing-sample-only counts.
Both paired terminal records restore the original method. Run verify-input.mjs
to check input-abba.json. This is Chrome/Vite development evidence, not native
typing, painted-frame, or production latency. Investigate indexed-route loss.

## Paired browser installation

The test-only `browser-vite.config.mjs` supplies an in-memory ESM copy through
`/__markbend_paired_state__.mjs`. It requires state 6.7.6 and the pinned source
hash. Run Vite with that config and open static-points.html with paired=1.
The ordinary Vite config does not supply this module. Production imports and
installed packages remain unchanged.

The wrapper validates the fixture route and original descriptor. Only explicit
minPointSize 0 calls use the candidate. Default and nonzero calls retain the
original method. Both routes retain all arguments and the receiver. Exceptions
restore and rethrow without callback replay. Disposal restores the original
descriptor only while the wrapper owns every descriptor flag. Status and
restoration do not call a later getter. Retained inactive wrappers use original.
Partial view setup destroys only constructors that returned, then restores.

paired-height-controls.json repeats all eighty navigation checks. The paired
edit archive repeats thirty-six checks. All retain exact geometry, source,
history, fonts, and selection under the same complete-tree controls. The global
patch affects both views, so full/full controls remain in the matrix. Direct
callback diagnostics use the captured original method as their baseline.
Both indexed candidate edits retain two callbacks. Each batch has 3,198 actual
dispatch jumps / 792,130 skipped ranges and 7,200 geometry-preparation jumps /
1,783,090 skipped ranges. Direct diagnostics add 398 / 98,705 separately.
These are batch counts, not single-key or elapsed-time measurements.

paired-final-smoke.json retains nine edit checks after failure-path fixes and
explicit restoration. paired-setup-failures.json checks cleanup in both view
construction orders. Eleven unit tests cover installation, arguments, fallback
exceptions, paired exceptions, disposal, later owners, and real callbacks.
Run `node tests/performance/experiments/point-comparison/verify-static-layout.mjs --paired`.
The browser's previous pending tab was absent after turn cleanup; its missing
edit record was repeated, not inferred. Next review real-input timing. Resource,
memory, frame, Open, IME, and supported-platform acceptance remain open.

Baseline: 38f8a88. macOS arm64, Apple M4, Node 22.23.2.
Production and installed packages are unchanged. No speed result is claimed.

## Comparator decision

Run `node tests/performance/experiments/point-comparison/check.mjs`.
The script reads installed CodeMirror state 6.7.6, checks its version and source
shape, resolves its one import, and creates two in-memory module copies. It
records the installed source SHA-256. Both use the same range sets and values
as the upstream comparison. No file in node_modules is written.

The naive copy lets findSharedChunks skip positive-point chunks. Three retained
examples change its callback stream: a shared positive point suppresses changed
inner points or marks in another set, but the naive copy reports those changes.
Removing common points can therefore change what the comparison sees.

The guarded copy enables that skip only after the upstream relevant-set filter,
when minPointSize is nonnegative, each side has exactly one relevant set, and
both sets have no nonempty next layer. Chunk identity, mapped position, and
touchesRange checks stay unchanged. Other calls retain upstream behavior.
The exact changes are in changed() and the guard string in check.mjs.

An initial batch of 3,240 spaced comparisons passed. Explicit touching points
and zero-length boundaries then disproved the guard. At source position zero,
the old shared positive point covers 0..10. The new side adds a zero point at
0..0 with equal side values. Upstream reports the old positive point and the
new zero point. The guard reports null and the new zero point. The shared old
point supplies required boundary context even with one layer per side.
guard-boundary-failure.log retains that first failure.

The final batch covers 3,456 comparisons, including chunk boundaries, edits,
zero points, touching points, side values, ranks, multiple sets, and layers.
It finds nine exact callback-stream mismatches among 2,364 eligible calls.
All fallback calls retain upstream behavior. check.log retains every failing
case, callback order, coordinates, values, and boundary notifications. The
script succeeds only when it retains the known rejection controls; its zero
exit status means the rejection check passes, not that the candidate is safe.
Reject this guard. Do not run browser or speed trials for it.

## Static projection evidence

The existing preview inventory now records versioned, read-only layer topology.
preview-eligibility.log shows that the original 1 MiB note preview has three
layers and the resource fixture has two. Neither can use the single-layer guard
without a different projection. These are settled-state fixtures, not input clocks.

static-projection.log separates all points, including zero-length line marks,
widgets, block and multiline replacements, from nonpoint text marks. Both
projections remain static. Each fixture's point projection has one layer before
and after a local edit. The represented static facet inputs include preview,
direction, active-line and search extensions. Dynamic decorations are excluded
as in installed view 6.43.13; static outer decorations are joined. Replacing the
preview input with both projections leaves one relevant single-layer input for
the height comparison in this representative state. This is not a native app
or complete host-extension acceptance claim.

static-spans.log retains a focused regression. At every selection boundary in
three mixed fixtures, point-first and mark-second match the combined full set
in strict comparison callbacks and public span records. The records include
active marks, open counts, and point rank. External decorations before and after
retain their order. The source record stays exact, including BOM and mixed
endings. Nested marks, multiline owners, lists, quotes, Setext headings, notes,
metadata, math, images, tables, Mermaid, HTML, and wide selections are covered.
A reversed-order nested control fails as required. This projection evidence
does not repair the invalid comparator guard.
The focused span check, opt-in inventory, TypeScript check, and Bend proof pass.
proof.log retains the Bend result. Production code is unchanged; no complete
app test or native input acceptance follows from this diagnostic batch.

The next design must skip matching chunks in both cursors together while
retaining shared-point context at changed boundaries. It needs another design
review and exact differential checks before layout or speed trials. Static
production replacements stay intact. Native frame, Open, memory, and platform
targets remain open.

## Paired candidate

The later inactive candidate in paired.mjs advances both cursors together.
It keeps the original shared-chunk skip for nonpositive chunks. A separate
identity set permits paired jumps only with one relevant single-layer input
per side and nonnegative minPointSize. Matching current point identity, mapped
bounds, sides, cursor index, and chunk position must agree. No active marks
can remain. A jump stays inside the current unchanged text gap and retains
the final eligible positive point through normal cursor operations. Following
zero points therefore keep the common point's boundary context.

paired.log records 3,496 exact callback streams through each of two loaders:
ESM and a strict injected factory. Each records 5,397 jumps and 1,324,988 skipped
ranges. The batch adds clipped points at both ends of multiple text gaps to
the earlier boundary, side, rank, layer, and mapped-chunk checks. The independent
skip guard still fails its retained controls. This is differential evidence
for the tested cases, not a formal proof or approval for app adoption.

The factory pins state 6.7.6 and SHA-256
cf4ffe7d177bf2c7c5da66c49be0811cc79a29e12cb658238876bbdcef12939c.
It checks and removes exactly the known import, final package export, and
diagnostic export, rejects remaining module syntax and await, and injects the
package dependency through public createRequire. The initial SSR import.meta
resolve and VM dynamic-import failures remain as setup-only logs. They supply
no comparison evidence. Both loaders run the generated stream checks before
the factory runs the preview check.

Run `MARKBEND_POINT_INVENTORY=1 npx vitest run tests/performance/preview-point-inventory.test.ts`.
paired-preview.log records real settled preview point projections. A complete
fresh oracle identifies changed regions; each region updates the mapped old
set with explicit filterFrom/filterTo. RangeSet.eq checks the resulting set,
then upstream and paired callbacks compare old and reconstructed sets through
the real text change. The 1 MiB note fixture retains two callbacks, with 398
jumps and 98,704 skipped ranges. The resource fixture retains nine callbacks
with no jumps. The large fixture requires nonzero jumps and skipped ranges.
paired-preview-unbounded-filter.log retains the earlier zero-hit control: a
filter without bounds rebuilds every chunk, even when it retains its ranges.

All reconstruction is outside clocks and scans the full oracle. It proves
possible chunk reuse and stream agreement, not a bounded production algorithm.
Production, installed modules, source record, baseline, and recovery remain
unchanged. Next build an inactive persistent static point projection that
patches actual local regions, then run full/full browser layout controls before
timings. Native frame, Open, memory, and platform acceptance remain open.

## Persistent static projection

static-preview.ts derives from the retained viewport snapshot, whose preview
logic matches the production baseline. It changes the projection to all points
and all nonpoint marks. Both inputs stay static in point-first order. It has no
viewport filter or view plugin. Initial and selection-only paths partition the
accepted full suppressed set. Local index callbacks partition only rebuilt
blocks and neighbours, then map and patch both old projections at those bounds.
Complete combined decorations remain for the index contract and checks.

Notes retain a separate ordinary projection. The combined point set maps and
patches the rebuilt ordinary region, then removes note widgets through bounded
filters at stable current note ranges and inserts the complete current overlay.
This preserves one layer. RangeSet.join of ordinary and note point sets would
create separate layers, even without overlap, and disable the paired guard.
Note rebuilding still scales with note count; no constant-cost claim is made.

Run `npx vitest run tests/web/static-preview-experiment.test.ts tests/web/static-point-projection.test.ts tests/web/note-preview-production.test.ts`.
static-local.log retains fifteen passing checks. The new five checks cover
strict callbacks including bound changes, public spans/open counts/point rank,
all mixed selection boundaries and external order, static facet inputs,
Unicode growth without iterating old layers, exact Undo/Redo and Source mode,
structural/note/resource/multiple-edit fallbacks, and partial-tree settlement.
Four actual growing edits in a 1 MiB note document keep old and new point sets
single-layer and require paired hits after every edit. They record 1,595 jumps
and 395,144 skipped ranges, with complete fresh-builder equality each time.
static-local-name-failure.log retains the initial snapshot name error.

These are state checks. Combined, ordinary, and split sets remain in memory.
No memory or speed improvement is claimed. Production imports no snapshot.
Next check full/full browser geometry in both construction orders with equal
fonts, widths, source record, and parser readiness. Do not time this route
until those controls pass. Native platform acceptance remains open.

## Browser static-projection geometry

Baseline: 29c3ec9, macOS arm64, Apple M4, Node 22.23.2, Chrome, Vite development
mode. Open tests/browser/static-points.html through Vite. Run layout batch with
all combinations of fixture=indexed (or absent for mixed text/note),
control=full (or absent for static candidate), and order=reverse (or absent).
The full reference uses the same snapshot's independent fresh builder and
widget classes. The experimental comparator is not installed or called.

static-height-controls.json retains eighty navigation checks: eight cases,
each with Top, Middle, End, Distant Find, owner navigation, width change, Find,
and three narrow navigation checks. Both editors have equal source, CSS, fonts,
and complete mounted Markdown bodies. Widths are 400 and 240 pixels. Each check
uses at least eight rAF samples and four successive equal transitions within
0.05 pixels, with a 1,200 ms deadline. Full/full and full/static both agree
exactly in estimated content height, DOM scroll height, scroll position,
relative caret top, shared actual line heights, and shared text. Full-document
semantic comparisons have no callbacks, including boundary changes. Source
stays exact with original BOM and mixed line endings and history zero.

static-edit-height-controls.json adds thirty-six checks. Use fixture=indexed
and Run edit layout batch for both control choices and construction orders.
The fixture dispatches one guarded local Unicode edit, then checks distant
navigation, width, Undo, Redo, Source mode, Live preview, and End. This is a
state dispatch followed by browser layout, not native typing. Both candidate
edits are indexed immediately and stay indexed after readiness. Later
navigation and history checks use full plans; their records state that mode.
Undo restores exact original source and history zero. Redo restores the exact
edited source and one history event. Selection and computed font properties
agree at every step. All thirty-six checks have exact geometry agreement.

Parser readiness uses ensureSyntaxTree and a no-op publication before sampling,
and requires complete mounted bodies in both views. It records candidate mode
before and after readiness. History and mode controls request the same explicit
scroll action in both views. This does not test reproduction of history scroll
effects by the mirror. The first nine-check edit run lacked those actions and
had partial trees. static-edit-readiness-failure.json retains that rejected run;
its large cursor deltas are not accepted projection evidence.

Run `node tests/performance/experiments/point-comparison/verify-static-layout.mjs`.
The verifier requires each matrix case and exact action sequence, nonempty
shared-line evidence, complete trees, stable samples, strict semantic equality,
and zero geometry differences. Edit checks also require exact expected source,
selection, fonts, history, original-source Undo, and indexed edit readiness.
static-layout-verification.log retains its result. The final candidate smoke
record confirms narrow End geometry with exact source. A screenshot was saved
at /tmp/markbend-static-layout.png. static-layout-proof.log retains the Bend gate.

These fixtures cover text and note widgets. Resource widget browser geometry,
input latency, native IME, memory, Open, and supported-platform acceptance remain
open. Production is unchanged. Next connect the inactive version/hash-pinned
paired comparator and repeat geometry controls before real-input timing.
